    <h2>Minecraft Herobrine</h2>
    <h4>Herobrine is a rumored Hostile Mob found in Minecraft. He is the center of endless speculation and Creepypasta, producing explanations of his origins such as a ghost, Notch's dead brother, revenge carried out by a fired Mojang employee, and a slew of others.</h4>
    <h4>Herobrine was popularized in 2010 by a video game streamer called Copeland in a hoax on Brocraft, his livestream channel of the video game Minecraft. ... In the original creepypasta, an anonymous Minecraft user reports running into another character while playing in single-player mode.</h4>
    <h4>Herobrine also is known to shave trees of their leaves, destroy buildings, create 2 X 2 tunnels lit via Redstone Torches, along with small sand pyramids. But that's not the quite the case: Herobrine is the Good Guy. Herobrine protects you from an evil entity known as Entity 303.</h4>
    <h4>Herobrine has Telepathic abilities, allowing him to communicate between Minds and to Read Minds. He can also use his Telepathic Abilities to Control Minds, to make a friendly mob turn against the player or to control hostile mobs.assassinsquid33. This command makes Herobrine speak whatever you wish him to say.</h4>
    <h4>Steve's design was changed from the default Steve Minecraft skin, with the skin designer Knightsabers adding more shading to make him look realistic. Steve's personality is based around Carrie White and Peter Parker.</h4>
    <h4>Herobrine finally dies during a duel with Nya, in which Nya fatally stabs him. Steve's Life from 0-24: Back in 6969, Herobrine arrived at Steve's parents' house.</h4>
